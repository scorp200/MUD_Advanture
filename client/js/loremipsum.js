window.backToTheIpsum = "<p>Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.</p>\
<p>Right, gimme a Pepsi free.</p>\
<p>Well, she's not doing a very good job.</p>\
<p>Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.</p>\
<p>The future, it's where you're going?</p>\
<p>Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.</p>\
<p>Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?</p>\
<p>Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.</p>\
<p>Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.</p>\
<p>Precisely.</p>\
<p>Lorraine.</p>\
<p>Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.</p>\
<p>It's a board with wheels.</p>\
<p>I will.</p>\
<p>Ahh. Ahh.</p>\
<p>Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-</p>\
<p>What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.</p>\
<p>Let's get him.</p>\
<p>Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?</p>\
<p>Your, your right.</p>\
<p>Well, this is a radiation suit.</p>\
<p>Yeah.</p>\
<p>I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.</p>\
<p>Marty. Marty. Marty.</p>\
<p>Holy shit.</p>\
<p>I will.</p>\
<p>Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?</p>\
<p>Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.</p>\
<p>Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.</p>\
<p>Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.</p>\
<p>He's your brother, Mom.</p>\
<p>I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.</p>\
<p>Right.</p>\
<p>Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?</p>\
<p>Oh.</p>\
<p>Looks like a airplane, without wings.</p>\
<p>Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.</p>\
<p>Lorenzo, where're you keys?</p>\
<p>You have this thing hooked up to the car?</p>\
<p>The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine.</p>\
<p>What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.</p>\
<p>The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social-</p>\
<p>Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-</p>\
<p>Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?</p>\
<p>Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.</p>\
<p>Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?</p>\
<p>Precisely.</p>\
<p>And he could sleep in my room.</p>\
<p>Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.</p>\
<p>I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future-</p>\
<p>Well uh, good, fine.</p>\
<p>Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.</p>\
<p>Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.</p>\
<p>Yeah okay.</p>\
<p>Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat?</p>\
<p>Okay.</p>\
<p>Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.</p>\
<p>Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?</p>\
<p>Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.</p>\
<p>Who's are these?</p>\
<p>C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo.</p>\
<p>Why is she gonna get angry with you?</p>\
<p>Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.</p>\
<p>Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?</p>\
<p>Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?</p>\
<p>Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.</p>\
<p>Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.</p>\
<p>My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.</p>\
<p>Yeah.</p>\
<p>The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out.</p>\
<p>Let's put him in there.</p>\
<p>Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.</p>\
<p>Oh, what I meant to day was-</p>\
<p>Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.</p>\
<p>Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?</p>\
<p>Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works.</p>\
<p>Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay.</p>\
<p>Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?</p>\
<p>Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.</p>\
<p>Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.</p>\
<p>Yeah, well history is gonna change.</p>\
<p>Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head.</p>\
<p>It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.</p>\
<p>Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.</p>\
<p>C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.</p>\
<p>Which one's your pop?</p>\
<p>How about a ride, Mister?</p>\
<p>She's just trying to keep you respectable.</p>\
<p>Yeah, it's in the back.</p>\
<p>Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?</p>\
<p>I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.</p>\
<p>Watch it, Goldie.</p>\
<p>Alright, punk, now-</p>\
<p>Yeah, it's 8:00.</p>\
<p>I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.</p>\
<p>Are you sure about this storm?</p>\
<p>C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.</p>\
<p>Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?</p>\
<p>Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-</p>";
